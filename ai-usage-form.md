## Section 1 — Declaration of AI Use  
I did use generative AI tools in completing this assignment, and I have documented all such use in Section 2.  

## Section 2 — Details of AI Use (Required if AI was used)  


| AI Tool Name & Version | Prompts / Questions Used                                                               | Type of Output Received                    | How Output Was Used or Modified                                                                                    |

| ChatGPT 5              | How to compile and run an OpenMP C program on a cluster node                           | Step-by-step instructions                  | Followed the instructions to compile `omp_hello.c` with OpenMP support and run it interactively on a compute node. |
| ChatGPT 5              | How to set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` and iterate runs with different thread counts             | Shell script example                       | Used the example to automate running `omp_hello` with multiple thread counts and repeats for data collection.      |
| ChatGPT 5              | How to modify a loop to iterate over powers of two instead of sequential thread counts | Modified bash loop snippet                 | Updated my shell script to run with 1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64 threads instead of 1–80 sequentially.                       |
| ChatGPT 5              | How to interpret OpenMP output timings from multiple runs                              | Explanation and example of timing analysis | Used the explanation to summarize execution times for each thread count in my homework report.                     |
| ChatGPT 5              | Difference between interactive and batch jobs in SLURM, and how to use `salloc`        | Educational explanation                    | Used to request a compute node interactively to run `omp_hello` without submitting a full batch script.            |


## Section 3 — Student Acknowledgment  

I understand that:  

- I am responsible for ensuring that all work submitted is my own and that I fully understand any AI-assisted content included.  
- All AI usage must be appropriately documented and substantially modified to reflect my own work.  
- Misrepresenting AI-generated work as entirely my own without disclosure may be considered a violation of academic integrity.

## Instructions to Students  

1. Complete this form for every assignment.  
2. If you used AI only for brainstorming or debugging, still disclose it.  
3. Attach the form to your submission in Word or PDF format.
