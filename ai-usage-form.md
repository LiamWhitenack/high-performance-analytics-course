## Section 3 — Student Acknowledgment

I understand that:

* I am responsible for ensuring that all work submitted is my own and that I fully understand any AI-assisted content included.
* All AI usage must be appropriately documented and substantially modified to reflect my own work.
* Misrepresenting AI-generated work as entirely my own without disclosure may be considered a violation of academic integrity.
