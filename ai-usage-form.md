## Section 1 — Declaration of AI Use  
I did use generative AI tools in completing this assignment, and I have documented all such use in Section 2.  

## Section 2 — Details of AI Use (Required if AI was used)  

| AI Tool Name & Version | Prompts / Questions Used                                                                                            | Type of Output Received                        | How Output Was Used or Modified                                                                            |

| ChatGPT 5              | How to use two kinds of parallelization in an Azul simulation                                                       | Conceptual explanation and implementation plan | Used the explanation to design a hybrid parallelism approach combining agent-based and task-based methods. |
| ChatGPT 5              | Can you explain what “kinds of parallelism” means? What is CUDA?                                                    | Educational explanation                        | Used to better understand types of parallel computing for a course project.                                |


## Section 3 — Student Acknowledgment  

I understand that:  

- I am responsible for ensuring that all work submitted is my own and that I fully understand any AI-assisted content included.  
- All AI usage must be appropriately documented and substantially modified to reflect my own work.  
- Misrepresenting AI-generated work as entirely my own without disclosure may be considered a violation of academic integrity.
