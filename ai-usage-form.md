## Section 1 — Declaration of AI Use  
I did use generative AI tools in completing this assignment, and I have documented all such use in Section 2.  

## Section 2 — Details of AI Use (Required if AI was used)  

| AI Tool Name & Version | Prompts / Questions Used        | Type of Output Received   | How Output Was Used or Modified |

| ChatGPT 5              | How to interpret output file   | Summary in Markdown       | I input the values and ChatGPT returned a summary in markdown. |

## Section 3 — Student Acknowledgment  

I understand that:  

- I am responsible for ensuring that all work submitted is my own and that I fully understand any AI-assisted content included.  
- All AI usage must be appropriately documented and substantially modified to reflect my own work.  
- Misrepresenting AI-generated work as entirely my own without disclosure may be considered a violation of academic integrity.
